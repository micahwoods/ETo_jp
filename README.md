The `ui.R` and `server.R` files make a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) app, online at https://asianturfgrass.shinyapps.io/et_calc_jp/.

This is a Japanese language version of the app making the same calculations at https://asianturfgrass.shinyapps.io/ET_calculator/ with code at https://github.com/micahwoods/ETo.
